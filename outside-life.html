With music, as a hobby, he wishes to study Jazz and become an artist later down the line. He has been doing competitive eSports since Dec. 7th, 2018 with the game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. He doesn't blink an eye to helping a family member move out or being the first to offer help if someone is in need.</p>
